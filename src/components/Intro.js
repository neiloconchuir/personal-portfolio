      <p>
        I am an Entry level/Junior Front-end Software Engineer with experience
        in Web Development with React, JavaScript, CSS and HTML. Though new to
        the tech industry I have nearly 20 years experience working in a
        demanding, client facing environment, delivering complicated injury
        rehabilitation protocols. Recently I have been working towards the
        Codecadamy FullStack Software Developer pathway. I am continuing to 
        compete personal projects as I try and enter the tech workplace.
